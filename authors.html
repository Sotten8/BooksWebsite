            capturing the human soul. Writing during the Renaissance, he crafted timeless tragedies and comedies that

            1,700 words, forever shaping the way we speak and write today.</td>

            the detective genre.</td>

          <td>A Nobel Prize winner and a giant of 20th-century literature, Ernest Hemingway was famous for his 'Iceberg
            Theory' of writing. His style was characterized by extreme minimalism and emotional depth hidden beneath
