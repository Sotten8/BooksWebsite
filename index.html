      <h3>History Of Books</h3>
      <p>So, should we start from the beginning? I guess so. I think it will be a cool journey through the centuries!

      <ol style="text-align: justify;">
        <li><b>Ancient Beginnings</b>
          <br>
          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around; gap: 20px">
            <p>Long before paper existed, people wanted to share their stories.The first "books" weren't made of paper
              at all. In <b>Ancient Mesopotamia</b>, people used clay tablets. They would scratch marks into wet clay
              and let it dry in the sun. Later, in <b>Ancient Egypt</b>, they discovered papyrus — a material made from
              a plant that grew along the Nile River. They rolled it into long scrolls, some of which were over 30
              meters long!</p>

        <li><b>From Scrolls to Pages</b>
          <br>
          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 20px">
            <p>Around the 1st century, the <b>codex</b> was born. This was the first time someone thought to fold sheets
              of parchment (made from animal skin) and sew them together. This changed everything: for the first time, a
              reader could flip through pages instead of unrolling a giant scroll. In the <b>Middle Ages</b>, monks
              spent years hand-copying books, decorating them with beautiful gold and colors. These were called
              <b>illuminated manuscripts</b>.

        <li><b>The Great Revolution</b>
          <br>
          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 20px">
            <p>The biggest turning point happened in the 1440s. <b>Johannes Gutenberg</b> invented the printing press in
              Germany. Suddenly, a book that took a year to copy by hand could be printed in a day. Knowledge was no
              longer just for the rich; it became available to everyone. This led to the <b>"Golden Age"</b> of
              literature, where famous writers like Shakespeare and Dickens could reach thousands of readers.</p>

        </li>

        <li><b>The Digital Era</b>
          <br>
          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 20px">
            <p>Today, we are living through another revolution. We still love the smell of paper and the feel of a
              physical book, but we also have <b>e-books</b> and <b>audiobooks</b>. We can carry an entire library in
              our pockets. However, the goal remains the same: to tell a story, share an idea, and connect one mind to
              another.</p>

      <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
      <p align="justify">In the end, books are more than just ink on paper; they are the <b>ultimate time machines</b>.
        They allow us to travel through centuries, explore distant worlds, and inhabit the minds of others. Writing a
        book is an act of courage — it is a way to turn the chaos of thought into a lasting legacy that can inspire
        generations to come...</p>
